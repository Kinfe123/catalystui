# Introducing CatalystUI

In the past few months, I've prototyped several toy projects to explore ideas, learn new things etc. 
Having a well thought out project starter is one of the crucial parts of being able to quickly build something and test out an idea. While I have a pretty solid
project starter, one thing that always slowed my down is a collection of components that I can use in my prototypes.

### Why build a component library in 2023, when there are plenty of other choices? 

I've tried a few component libraries over the years but I found it hard to settle on one. Last year, I found out about Radix UI primitives. I instantly liked it.
They were unstyled, had built-in accessibility and keyboard navigation, and a nice API. And they can be styled with whatever technology we want. I'm a huge fan of Tailwind,
so naturally I chose that. Pretty soon, I had a collection of styled components that I can use for my prototypes, and I included them in my starter.

But I ran into a problem. Making changes to these components meant that the components began to diverge across my projects and copy-pasting got tired very fast.
So I decided to bite the bullet and build a component library. CatalystUI is the result of this work.

### Why Catalyst?
