# Catalyst UI

Catalyst UI is a component library built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS.

<Callout type='error'>
	Catalyst UI is in early stages of development. It's not ready for production
	use (although I use it in production since I need it). Feel free to modify
	it and use in production at your own risk.
