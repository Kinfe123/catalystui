# Catalyst UI

Catalyst UI is a component library built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS.

<Callout type='warning'>
	Catalyst UI is NOT affiliated with Tailwind Labs and Radix UI (and by
	extension, WorkOS) in any way. This is NOT the Catalyst that Adam Wathan
	talked about in his keynote at Tailwind Connect 2023. This is a passion
	project that I built for my own use and is NOT the upcoming UI kit from
	Tailwind Labs.
</Callout>

<Callout type='warning'>
	Catalyst UI is in early stages of development. It's not ready for production
	use yet (although I use it in production since I need it) and APIs may
	change. Feel free to modify it and use in production at your own risk. If
	you have suggestions on how to improve it, please open an issue on GitHub.
</Callout>

<Callout type='warning'>
	Catalyst UI is not exhaustive. It doesn't include all the Radix primitives
	yet. I'm working on supporting all of them. If you need a component that's
	not included, please open an issue on GitHub.
