# Catalyst UI

Catalyst UI is a component library built on top of Radix UI primitives and styled with Tailwind CSS.

<Callout type='error'>
	Catalyst UI is in early stages of development. It's not ready for production
	use yet (although I use it in production since I need it) and APIs may
	change. Feel free to modify it and use in production at your own risk. If
	you have suggestions on how to improve it, please open an issue on GitHub.
